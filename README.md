## 🚀 Features
1. **Decentralized Project Storage** – Projects are stored inside the `Projects` folder, enhancing transparency and ownership.
2. **Simple and Intuitive** – Built using HTML and CSS, this platform is easy to navigate and minimalistic in design.
3. **Smart Contract Integration** – The platform uses smart contracts (Solidity) for handling project metadata such as names, owners, and repository links.
4. **Fork and Contribute Easily** – Anyone can fork the repository, contribute by adding projects, and create pull requests.
5. **Community Focused** – Designed to help developers collaborate and showcase their work while maintaining full ownership of their code.

## 📂 Project Structure
The projects are stored in a directory format:
- **Main Directory**: Contains all essential files, including the smart contract `deproject.sol`.
- **Assets Folder**: Contains the `Projects` folder where all the contributed projects are stored.
- **Projects Folder**: Inside `assets/Projects`, you can add your own projects with clear file names.
